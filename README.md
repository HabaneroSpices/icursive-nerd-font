## Preview

For a preview of all available fonts, see [this wiki page](https://github.com/sainnhe/icursive-nerd-font/wiki/Preview).

## Introduction

Many vscode users use fonts like this with some themes that support italics, I want to do the same in vim. I've tried [FiraCodeiScript](https://github.com/kencrocken/FiraCodeiScript), [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles) and [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) but their support for nerd font symbols is not very good.

Therefore, I decided to patch some fonts myself. All these fonts should support nerd font symbols and be suitable for use in TUI editors like vim.

Some fonts are free of charge, they are patched already and you can directly use the binary files. However, some fonts are not free, so you need to build them by yourself if you want to use them.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. If you want to install non-free fonts, you need to buy the fonts and build them by yourself.
3. For linux users, follow this [guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fonts#Manual_installation) to install them.

In order to avoid copyright infringement, I cannot directly distribute the binary files of some fonts. However, if you encounter problems during the build process, [email me](mailto:sainnhe@gmail.com) and I will send you the font files that have been built.

For Arch Linux users, you can directly install all these fonts from [my repository](https://repo.sainnhe.dev/archlinux/). All these fonts are in a package group named `icursive-nerd-fonts`, so simply add this repository and install them via `pacman -S icursive-nerd-fonts`.

### Build
